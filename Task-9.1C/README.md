# Merged React (CRA)

Run with the usual Create React App commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Routes

- `/` – LoginPage (from your Login project)
- `/signup` – SignupPage
- `/home` – Home project with an added button to go to `/next`
- `/next` – Articles' PostForm
- `/next/find` – Articles' FindQuestionPage

Your original files are inside `src/login`, `src/home`, and `src/articles` untouched.
